# Sparsh

## HackOff 3.0 project. A braille reader for everything!



Welcome to our repository. Sparsh is a device that we made so that we 
can help blind people read anytime and anywhere. The average device that blind people use cost above 1 lakh rupees but we've found a low cost efficient solution "Sparsh".


Sparsh has a camera at it's bottom which will read any document kept under it. Once the document text is read, the user could keep his/her hand on the 6 cylinder actuators to feel the output. To make the reading more comprehensive we have added a speaker to the node and a headphone jack to the device so the user can listen to what they're reading while feeling the braille output.

* Python 2 
* Python 3
