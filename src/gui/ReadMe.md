# Sparsh GUI

The GUI for sparsh is built using PyQt5. It is a replica of the hardware interface on the actual device that was ideated for HackOff v3.0.

It allows the user to control the rate of Braille feedback, and specify exactly when to start, stop, record text or recall text.

In the directory ```gui/scripts``` run using:

```
python3 sparsh_gui_1.py
```

or

```
./sparsh_gui_1.py
```
